This repo involves two state-of-the-art algorithms: FCOS3D and PETR, based on the MMDetection3D framework. Our improvements have been integrated into a production-ready 3D detection solution for autonomous driving camera perception. The solution includes two key frameworks: Mono3D and 7V BEV, both of which have been deployed in production across tens of thousands of vehicles, including those from FAW, Hezhong, and GAC.
